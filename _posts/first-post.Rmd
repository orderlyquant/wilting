```

## package `timetk`

The `timetk` package offers a lot of nice wrapper functions, here is one that is
useful to create a uniform series of dates

```{r}

library(timetk)

tk_make_timeseries("2010", length_out = 12, by = "year")

```

Note that the `by` argument makes this very flexible

```{r}

tk_make_timeseries("2010", length_out = 12*4, by = "quarter")

```

```{r}

tk_make_timeseries("2010", length_out = 12*12, by = "month")

```
