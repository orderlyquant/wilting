```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

For reminders on how to:

- comprehend the [build workflow](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html)
- create a [post](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/blog_workflow.html)
    - `distill::create_post()` - see help for details
    - importantly, [drafts](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/blog_workflow.html#draft-option)
      are marked in YAML with `draft: true`

## Miscellaneous

- if a link doesn't begin with "http" or "https", it will be interpreted as a relative
  path...**you've been warned!!!**
- code_folding is nice to have as an option. I prefer it on a per chunk
  basis, so:
    - add `code_folding: true` to the YAML see [here](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/#code-folding)
    - set knitr chunk options: `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, code_folding = FALSE)`
    - in the chunk where you want code folding, set `code_folding=TRUE` or
      `code_folding="code"` in the chunk header.
