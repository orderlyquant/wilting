    "contents": "\nToday, I worked on the following:\nsetting up this blog\nrunning through the weekly Free R Tip from business-science\nread through GIT SQL Together\nDistill blog\nSet up this blog using the distill package and github pages. A few takeaways:\nsee here for details on getting your repo right\nsee About for other details\nFree R Tip\nThis week’s tip was about many ways to create data frames/tibbles. I was familiar with these, but found the use of timetk::tk_make_timeseries informative.\n\n\ntibble::tibble(\n    date          = timetk::tk_make_timeseries(\"2010\", length_out = 12, by = \"quarter\"),\n    interest_rate = (seq(12, 3, length.out = 12) * (sin(1:12) + 2)) / 12\n)\n\n\n# A tibble: 12 x 2\n   date       interest_rate\n   <date>             <dbl>\n 1 2010-01-01         2.84 \n 2 2010-04-01         2.71 \n 3 2010-07-01         1.85 \n 4 2010-10-01         0.989\n 5 2011-01-01         0.757\n 6 2011-04-01         1.13 \n 7 2011-07-01         1.57 \n 8 2011-10-01         1.56 \n 9 2012-01-01         1.10 \n10 2012-04-01         0.563\n11 2012-07-01         0.318\n12 2012-10-01         0.366\n\nNote that the by argument is very flexible:\nby - a character string, containing one of “sec”, “min”, “hour”, “day”, “week”, “month”, “quarter” or “year”. You can create regularly spaced sequences using phrases like by = “10 min”\nGIT + SQL\nYou will always need that query again, so “GIT” it\nQueries change through time, you may need a previous version when you realize the improved query “broke” something in a way that wasn’t immediately obvious\nsave with a .sql extension\n\nLooks like there are other interesting posts from this site. I added one to Notion, so it may be covered here someday.\n\n\n\n",
